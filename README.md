# Fraud_detection
Our fraud detection model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze transactional data and customer demographics data to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate fraudulent activities.


Fraud detection is a critical aspect of any business that deals with financial transactions. With the rise of digital transactions, fraudsters have become more sophisticated in their methods, making it challenging to detect fraudulent activities. However, with the help of machine learning algorithms, businesses can now build robust fraud detection models that can identify fraudulent activities in real-time.
